# MAGIC # MLflow
# MAGIC
# MAGIC <a href="https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/concepts.html" target="_blank">MLflow</a> seeks to address these three core issues:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * It’s difficult to keep track of experiments
# MAGIC * It’s difficult to reproduce code
# MAGIC * There’s no standard way to package and deploy models
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In the past, when examining a problem, you would have to manually keep track of the many models you created, as well as their associated parameters and metrics. This can quickly become tedious and take up valuable time, which is where MLflow comes in.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC MLflow is pre-installed on the Databricks Runtime for ML.

# MAGIC ### MLflow Tracking
# MAGIC
# MAGIC MLflow Tracking is a logging API specific for machine learning and agnostic to libraries and environments that do the training.  It is organized around the concept of **runs**, which are executions of data science code.  Runs are aggregated into **experiments** where many runs can be a part of a given experiment and an MLflow server can host many experiments.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You can use <a href="https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.html#mlflow.set_experiment" target="_blank">mlflow.set_experiment()</a> to set an experiment, but if you do not specify an experiment, it will automatically be scoped to this notebook.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC ### Track Runs
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Each run can record the following information:<br><br>
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **Parameters:** Key-value pairs of input parameters such as the number of trees in a random forest model
# MAGIC - **Metrics:** Evaluation metrics such as RMSE or Area Under the ROC Curve
# MAGIC - **Artifacts:** Arbitrary output files in any format.  This can include images, pickled models, and data files
# MAGIC - **Source:** The code that originally ran the experiment
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **NOTE**: For Spark models, MLflow can only log PipelineModels.

# MAGIC ### Querying Past Runs
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You can query past runs programmatically in order to use this data back in Python.  The pathway to doing this is an **`MlflowClient`** object.

# COMMAND ----------

from mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You can also use <a href="https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/search-syntax.html" target="_blank">search_runs</a> to find all runs for a given experiment.

# COMMAND ----------

experiment_id = run.info.experiment_id
runs_df = mlflow.search_runs(experiment_id)

display(runs_df)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Pull the last run and look at metrics.

# COMMAND ----------

runs = client.search_runs(experiment_id, order_by=["attributes.start_time desc"], max_results=1)
runs[0].data.metrics

# COMMAND ----------

runs[0].info.run_id

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Examine the results in the UI.  Look for the following:<br><br>
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. The **`Experiment ID`**
# MAGIC 2. The artifact location.  This is where the artifacts are stored in DBFS.
# MAGIC 3. The time the run was executed.  **Click this to see more information on the run.**
# MAGIC 4. The code that executed the run.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC After clicking on the time of the run, take a look at the following:<br><br>
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. The Run ID will match what we printed above
# MAGIC 2. The model that we saved, included a pickled version of the model as well as the Conda environment and the **`MLmodel`** file.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Note that you can add notes under the "Notes" tab to help keep track of important information about your models. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Also, click on the run for the log normal distribution and see that the histogram is saved in "Artifacts".

# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Load Saved Model
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's practice <a href="https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.spark.html" target="_blank">loading</a> our logged log-normal model.

# COMMAND ----------

model_path = f"runs:/{run.info.run_id}/model"
loaded_model = mlflow.sklearn.load_model(model_path)
