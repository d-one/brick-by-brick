# MAGIC # Model Registry
# MAGIC
# MAGIC MLflow Model Registry is a collaborative hub where teams can share ML models, work together from experimentation to online testing and production, integrate with approval and governance workflows, and monitor ML deployments and their performance.  This notebook explores how to manage models using the MLflow model registry.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this notebook we will:
# MAGIC  - Register a model using MLflow
# MAGIC  - Manage the model lifecycle
# MAGIC  - Archive and delete models

# MAGIC ### Model Registry
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The MLflow Model Registry component is a centralized model store, set of APIs, and UI, to collaboratively manage the full lifecycle of an MLflow Model. It provides model lineage (which MLflow Experiment and Run produced the model), model versioning, stage transitions (e.g. from staging to production), annotations (e.g. with comments, tags), and deployment management (e.g. which production jobs have requested a specific model version).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Model registry has the following features:<br><br>
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * **Central Repository:** Register MLflow models with the MLflow Model Registry. A registered model has a unique name, version, stage, and other metadata.
# MAGIC * **Model Versioning:** Automatically keep track of versions for registered models when updated.
# MAGIC * **Model Stage:** Assigned preset or custom stages to each model version, like “Staging” and “Production” to represent the lifecycle of a model.
# MAGIC * **Model Stage Transitions:** Record new registration events or changes as activities that automatically log users, changes, and additional metadata such as comments.
# MAGIC * **CI/CD Workflow Integration:** Record stage transitions, request, review and approve changes as part of CI/CD pipelines for better control and governance.

# MAGIC ### Registering a Model
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The following workflow will work with either the UI or in pure Python.  This notebook will use pure Python.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Explore the UI throughout this NOTEBOOK by clicking the "Models" tab on the left-hand side of the screen.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Train a model and log it to MLflow using <a href="https://docs.databricks.com/applications/mlflow/databricks-autologging.html" target="_blank">autologging</a>. Autologging allows you to log metrics, parameters, and models without the need for explicit log statements.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC There are a few ways to use autologging:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC   1. Call **`mlflow.autolog()`** before your training code. This will enable autologging for each supported library you have installed as soon as you import it.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC   2. Enable autologging at the workspace level from the admin console
# MAGIC
# MAGIC   3. Use library-specific autolog calls for each library you use in your code. (e.g. **`mlflow.spark.autolog()`**)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Here we are only using numeric features for simplicity of building the random forest.

# MAGIC ### Deploying a Model
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The MLflow Model Registry defines several model stages: **`None`**, **`Staging`**, **`Production`**, and **`Archived`**. Each stage has a unique meaning. For example, **`Staging`** is meant for model testing, while **`Production`** is for models that have completed the testing or review processes and have been deployed to applications. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Users with appropriate permissions can transition models between stages.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now that you've learned about stage transitions, transition the model to the **`Production`** stage.

# COMMAND ----------

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Fetch the latest model using a **`pyfunc`**.  Loading the model in this way allows us to use the model regardless of the package that was used to train it.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC NOTE!! You can load a specific version of the model too.

# COMMAND ----------

model_version_uri = f"models:/{model_name}/1"

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Review
# MAGIC **Question:** How does MLflow tracking differ from the model registry?  
# MAGIC **Answer:** Tracking is meant for experimentation and development.  The model registry is designed to take a model from tracking and put it through staging and into production.  This is often the point that a data engineer or a machine learning engineer takes responsibility for the deployment process.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Question:** Why do I need a model registry?  
# MAGIC **Answer:** Just as MLflow tracking provides end-to-end reproducibility for the machine learning training process, a model registry provides reproducibility and governance for the deployment process.  Since production systems are mission critical, components can be isolated with ACL's so only specific individuals can alter production models.  Version control and CI/CD workflow integration is also a critical dimension of deploying models into production.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Question:** What can I do programmatically versus using the UI?  
# MAGIC **Answer:** Most operations can be done using the UI or in pure Python.  A model must be tracked using Python, but from that point on everything can be done either way.  For instance, a model logged using the MLflow tracking API can then be registered using the UI and can then be pushed into production.
